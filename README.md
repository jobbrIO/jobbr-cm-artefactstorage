This Repository contains a speficications, aka. Component Models for implementing additional **Artefact Storages** for [Jobbr](https://www.jobbr.io).


> **What is Jobbr**?
> Jobbr is a .NET job server. It is designed to reduce artifical complexity when a job server is needed in a project. Jobbr tries to get out of your way as much as possible so that you can focus on business logic. Job implementations have no dependency to Jobbr which makes it easy to integrate Jobbr in any .NET project.


Please see [ReadTheDocs/Architecture](http://jobbr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/architecture.html#) for the general approach and information how Component Models work. Don't miss the chance to read [ReadTheDocs/Extend Jobbr](http://jobbr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/extend.html) if you want to build your own component for Jobbr.

### Issues
There is no issue tracker, please head to the concrete implementation of your **Artefact Storage** in use or create an issue on the jobbrIO/jobbr-server repository.
